The difference Between Text Editors and IDEs

Here are a few examples highlighting the differences

 A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title - it edit text. It also manages text, and manage files.

 An IDE (Intergrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together.

 An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in on software package.
