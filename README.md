Hi my name is **Domaine**! I love <sub>Javascript</sub> and <sub>crafts</sub>.

Growth mindset is the ability to have a positive outlook towards yourself. It's the capacity to approach a situation using your strenghts and a willingness to learn and grow from past mistakes as life goes on. 

3 remainders to keep myself in the growth mindset:

- Keep going don't give up!
- Believe in yourself for life is a marathon not a sprint.
- We all start from level zero and gradually grow.
